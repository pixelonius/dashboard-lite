General Context
Keep the top cards exactly as they are.
 We’ll focus on improving the students table and adding a popup (modal) for editing each student’s details.
 All existing data should be pre-filled from the current database (or mock data for now).
 Edits will be saved later when we hook up the backend — for now, just make the UI consistent, clean, and easy to extend.

Main Flow
Each student row in the table gets an View Student button.
 Clicking it opens a popup for that student.
At the top of the popup, there’s a toggle bar (like segmented buttons) with five sections:
Personal Info (default)


Onboarding


Payment Tracking


Progress Tracking


Student Checkin


Switching between sections updates the view inside the same popup.

Section Details
1. Personal Info (default tab)
This section shows and allows editing of:
Name


Email


Start Date


End Date


Status: 3 checkboxes (Active, Inactive, Pause) — only one can be checked at a time


If “Pause” is checked, show two date fields: Pause Start Date and Pause End Date


CSM: dropdown with values from the team_members table, where role is CSM and is_active is TRUE


Referral: checkbox (default unchecked)


Program: dropdown


Progress tracker sheet: field(s) for one or more links


Notes: text area for writing comments or updates


Save button to save all fields (pre-filled from current data)



2. Onboarding
This section has checkboxes for the student’s onboarding tasks.
Each one can be toggled on/off.
 When a box is checked or unchecked, it should instantly update the state (later the database).
 For now, just make it update the mock data so it feels live.
Checklist items:
OB Calls Completed


Slack profile setup


Kajabi access granted


Invited to relevant Slack channels


Introduction video/message posted


Access to AST calendar


Asked about main goals


Posted in mock calls channel


Posted in wins channel


Posted in mind & body channel


Asked for 5 referrals


Booked the first 2 one-on-one calls during the onboarding week


Each change should be reflected immediately in the UI.


3. Payment Tracking
This section manages how the student is paying.
Fields:
Program Price


Total Paid


Plan Type (dropdown: PIF or Split Pay)


If Split Pay is selected, show an Installments dropdown (values 2–5).
 When the number of installments is chosen, create that many rows, each with:
Payment Due Date


Payment Amount


Example:
 If “Split Pay” and “3 Installments” are selected → show:
First Payment Due Date / Amount


Second Payment Due Date / Amount


Third Payment Due Date / Amount


Add a Save button to store this info later (for now, just mock the save).

4. Progress Tracking
Split this section visually into two parts:
On the left, a scrollable list/table of all weeks, showing:


Week number


Outcome


A button “View Week”


On the right, show details for the selected week:


Outcome (dropdown: Satisfied / Needs Attention / Risk of Refund)


Notes (text area)


A checklist (if any) for that week


A Save button


The user should be able to navigate through weeks and update outcomes/notes.

5. Student Checkin
A table for student check-ins submitted by the student, showing:
Date


Name


Email


Outcome


“View Full Response” button


Clicking that button opens another popup (on top of the existing one).
 This smaller popup shows:
The full written response


A dropdown for selecting an outcome:


Satisfied


Unsatisfied


Needs Attention


Refund Risk


A Submit button to save that choice (mocked for now)


When the user saves, the outcome should update in the table.

Design Guidelines
Keep the design clean, consistent, and minimal


Use clear spacing and readable typography


All modals and popups should be responsive and keyboard accessible


Make sure toggles and dropdowns feel smooth and intuitive


Use consistent date pickers and checkbox styling


Show success toasts or small “Saved” messages after saving



Behavior Summary
Personal Info: changes saved when “Save” is clicked


Onboarding: changes saved automatically when toggled


Payment Tracking: saved when “Save” is clicked


Progress Tracking: saved when “Save” is clicked


Check-ins: outcome saved when “Submit” is clicked



Before Starting
Review the git history to make sure recent manual edits aren’t overwritten.


Keep code clean and isolated to just the CSM page for now.


No backend calls yet — use local mock data or a simple state object.


Keep the top summary cards untouched.
